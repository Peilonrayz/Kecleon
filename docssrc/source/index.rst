Rename
++++++

-   Replace ``skeleton_py`` with the name of the other app. I've tried my best future self, but some just have to exist! ðŸ˜¥

    Locations:

    -   9 in ``READEME.rst``
    -   7 in ``setup.py``
    -   1 in ``docssrc/source/conf.py``
    -   10 in ``docssrc/source/index.rst``
    -   1 in ``docssrc/source/main.rst``
    -   2 in ``src/skeleton_py/main.py``
    -   1 in ``tests/test_main.py``
    -   Directory ``src/skeleton_py``

GitHub documentation
++++++++++++++++++++

1. Ensure ``docs/`` has been pushed to GitHub.
2. Enter project settings.
3. Enable GitHub Pages.
4. Ensure "*master branch /docs folder*" is selected.

Uploading to PyPI
+++++++++++++++++

.. code:: shell

   $ python -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools twine wheel
   $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   $ python -m twine upload dist/*

Structure
---------
Tests
+++++

This goes on to run the following:

-   `pytest`_ to run the tests located in ``tests/``, with `coverage`_.
-   Builds a `coverage`_ report, located at ``htmlcov/index.html``.
-   Hint the project utilizing `isort`_ and `black`_.
-   Lint the project using `nox`_ and `vox`_.
-   Build documentation using `Sphinx`_, located at ``docs/main.html``.

    -   Runs doctests.
    -   Ensures links are not dead.
    -   Auto documents type hints, via `sphinx-autodoc-typehints`_.

Sources
+++++++

This skeleton comes with three source locations. 

Documentation

   ``docsrc/``

   This is not the standard location ``docs/`` as GitHub requires that to be the built location.
   This means that once a documentation change has happened; the change can go live ASAP.

Code

   ``src/skeleton_py/``

   This utilizes the ``src/`` pattern.
   This has the benefit that less changes need to be made to remove all the ``skeleton_py`` names to the new project.
   It also has the benefit that ``import skeleton_py`` won't work without first installing it.

Tests

   ``tests/``

   This is your standard test folder.
   We are utilizing `pytest`_ as the test runner.
